will need to write eight functions in the stats.c implementation file
 main() - The main entry point for your program

print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.

print_array() -  Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen

find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value

find_mean() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean

find_maximum() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum

find_minimum() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum

sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest.  (The zeroth Element should be the largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value. )

Most of the functions in the stats.c file require 2 input parameters and one return value:

Input: A unsigned char pointer to an n-element data array

Input: An unsigned integer as the size of the array

Output: An unsigned char result from the function

The stats.h header file needs to include declarations and documentation for the functions from the stats.c file.
